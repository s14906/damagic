# Damagic
## Damagic plugin for Minecraft Server (Spigot)

This plugin displays the damage done to mobs as a text value floating above their heads, meaning the exact health points being reduced as a result of player's attack or other factors like environmental damage. The text value changes its color depending on the damage source (physical damage is white, fire-based damage is orange, poison-based damage is orange, etc.).
